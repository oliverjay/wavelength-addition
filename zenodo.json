  "title": "Beyond Einstein: A Complete Unified Field Theory from Wavelength Addition Principles",
  "description": "Complete implementation of Wavelength Field Theory - a proposed unified field theory where all fundamental forces emerge from electromagnetic interactions through wavelength field dynamics. The theory addresses major challenges in modern physics whilst making specific, falsifiable predictions for upcoming experiments.",
