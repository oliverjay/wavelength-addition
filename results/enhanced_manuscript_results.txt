Script: enhanced_manuscript_improvements.py
Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

KEY FINDINGS:

1. COMPLETE VELOCITY MODIFICATION DERIVATION
   - Modified Maxwell equations with wavelength field coupling
   - Effective permittivity: ε_eff = ε₀[1 + g₂φ²/Λ²]
   - Effective permeability: μ_eff = μ₀[1 + g₁φ²/Λ²]
   - Phase velocity: v_phase = c/√[1 + (g₁ + g₂)φ²/Λ²]
   - Connection to wavelength addition: v = c × λ_new/(λ_new + λ_field)

2. SCALAR MODE COUPLING ANALYSIS
   - Metric perturbations with scalar and tensor modes
   - Modified Einstein equations with field stress-energy
   - Eigenmode decomposition with dispersion matrix
   - Mixing suppression: α² = 5.33e-05
   - Tensor modes propagate at speed c (preserves GR)

3. SIGNAL-TO-NOISE ANALYSIS
   - Binary Pulsar Timing (SKA): SNR = 427.2, Detection confidence: High
   - Gravitational Lensing (EHT): SNR = 1.6, Detection confidence: Marginal
   - Gamma-Ray Burst Time Delays (Fermi): SNR = 31.6, Detection confidence: Very High
   - Laboratory Interferometry (Advanced LIGO): SNR = 1.9, Detection confidence: Low

4. EXPANDED THEORY COMPARISON
   - WFT: 4 falsifiable predictions, CMB mod 0.05%, GW scalar mode suppressed by α²
   - ΛCDM: 0 predictions, no CMB mod, tensor modes only
   - Modified Gravity (f(R)): 2 predictions, CMB mod ~1%, additional scalar mode
   - Extra Dimensions: 1 prediction, model dependent, additional polarizations
   - String Theory: 0 predictions, highly model dependent, multiple additional modes

5. MODERATED TECHNOLOGICAL PROSPECTS
   - Gravitational Field Manipulation: Speculative but theoretically grounded (2040+)
   - Advanced Propulsion: Long-term possibility requiring major breakthroughs (2050+)
   - Energy Harvesting: Possible but efficiency likely very low (2045+)
   - Ultra-Sensitive Detection: Most promising near-term application (2025-2030)
